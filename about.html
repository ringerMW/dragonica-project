										<b>The universe is huge and diverse.</b>
										<br><br>
										In it, the world of dragons, the world of people and the world of gods simultaneously exist. The adventures of the players begin in the world of humans, but the source of all troubles and conflicts lies in the world of dragons. So that you can better understand the scale of the chaos that has engulfed the continent, we will tell you the story of the game.
										<br><br>
										<b>The history of the world.</b><br><br>
										All the dragons of the world are ruled by a creature known as the Dragon Lord. The Dragon Lord possessed five artifacts that granted him the power of the five elements and eternal life. The Dragon Lord could only lose his title at will, but with one condition: the next Dragon Lord had to be elected immediately.
										<br><br>
										Over time, the twenty-seventh Dragon Lord named Wyvern felt that he would soon have to give up the title of Lord. He planned to make the commander of the First Guard his heir.
										<br><br>
										When the commander of the Second Guard found out about this, he became angry and began to wait for the night when the black moon would rise – it was at this moment that the strength of the commander of the Second Guard reached its limit. When the moment came, the commander of the Second Guard ambushed the Wyvern, and it died from his paws. And already at the moment when life was leaving the Dragon Lord, he sent the artifacts to another world. So they slipped right out from under the nose of the commander of the Second Guard.
										<br><br>
										'<i>Wyvern!</i> - he cried. - <i>How dare you stand in the way of my destiny?!</i> '
										<br><br>
										Because of Elga, the commander of the Second Guard, a war between the dragons began, in which a third party was soon involved…

										<b>Black Dragon Lord Elga</b><br><br>
										After recovering, Elga began searching for five lost artifacts – and eventually found them in the human world. Meanwhile, Decode, the commander of the First Guard, became aware of Elga's betrayal. He immediately went after Elga to punish him for his crime.
										<br><br>
										Once upon a time, humans and dragons fought fiercely for absolute power. But over time, both of them realized that they were not destined to rule the whole world. And then they made an agreement, sealing it with an oath to keep the peace. And so, a thousand years after the conclusion of this agreement, Elga went to the human world.
										<br><br>
										I must say that dragons live for a very, very long time, so they still remembered the war. The appearance of Elga became a serious threat to the human world, because this time people did not have five legendary heroes who could protect their world.
										<br><br>
										Elga's plans included not only taking possession of artifacts – he wanted to rule the human world. The belated arrival of Decode, the commander of the First Guard, was a miracle, but even that was not enough to stop Elga and his followers.
										Elga was followed by many dragons, and the five dragons from the Second Guard were much stronger in battle than the dragons of the First Guard.
										<br><br><br>
										<b>The Chosen</b><br><br>
										Since the beginning of time, there have been elementals - embodiments of the elements hiding in the Divine Five artifacts. The fire elemental Vulcanus, the water elemental Triton, the wood elemental Agato, the metal elemental Gorgon and the Earth elemental Geb all shared their power with the Dragon Lord. The elementals originally belonged to the gods, who collected them over long centuries filled with wars and strife. Then the artifacts ended up with the dragons, who protected the sacred relics and passed them only to the most worthy. Released after the death of the Wyvern, the elementals themselves began to search for a new master. In the world of people, the incarnations of the elements have chosen one hero for themselves:
										<br><br>
										<ol>
											<li>• Gladiator Skipi became the heir to the will of fire;</li><br>
											<li>• The white magician Mirine has known the freedom of water;</li><br>
											<li>• Archer Parmir felt the life force of the trees;</li><br>
											<li>• The black sorceress Faris conquered the power of metal;</li><br>
											<li>• The thief Belkan has comprehended the patience of the earth.</li><br><br>
										</ol>
										Five people turned out to be descendants of the great heroes of the ancient war. Together with the commander of the First Guard, they managed to stop Elga and imprison him in a prison called the Chamber of Shadows. Everyone thought that the main problem was solved.

										<b>Renegade Girl</b>
										<br><br>
										In the end, Elga was defeated and was locked up in a prison in the human world. Hundreds of meters of heavy chains and dozens of magic needles stuck into his body kept him in prison, depriving him of strength. But one day Faris, the embodiment of the metal elemental, freed Elga with one condition: the dragon would give his heart to Faris, thereby granting her immortality and eternal youth. Having fulfilled all the conditions of the deal, however, Elga did not get freedom, but he was not very upset, because the power of the metal artifact that was enclosed in Faris would sooner or later come under Elga's control. A few months passed and the sorceress disappeared from the human world without a trace... <br><br>
										A thousand years have passed since then. Time has consumed the lives of the heroes, and the artifacts needed new Favorites. When laying out the City of Five Heroes, people sealed the artifacts in stone so that no one could touch them – until the rightful owner of the elementals was found.
										<br><br>
										Meanwhile, the missing fourth artifact has reappeared in the human world. The power of its owner was evil and dark, and the bearer of the artifact used only the blackest magic...

										<b>The Liberation of the Black Dragon Lord</b><br><br>
										The creature in the dark robe was inexorably approaching the cell where the captive Elga was languishing. The guards tried to stop the dark-robed figure.
										<br><br>
										- <i>Stop! Identify yourself!</i>
										<br><br>
										- <i>Do not interfere, you vile creatures!</i>
										<br><br>
										One movement of the hand - and the soldiers collapsed to the ground senseless, and the dark figure moved on to the cell, not even bothering to look for the key in the pockets of the guards. The enchanted door behind which Elga languished was the last thing that worried her.
										<br><br>
										Elga was not surprised by the unexpected guest. He had known for a long time that she was coming, and greeted her:
										<br><br>
										- <i>Welcome back, my witch... Faris!</i>
										<br><br>
										– <i>You have waited a long time, Lord Elga.</i>
										<br><br>
										Yes, it was Faris. Dark robes hid the one who had finally turned into a witch. The sorceress took out hundreds of needles that held Elga, and as soon as the last needle left Elga's body, he was able to breathe deeply for the first time in thousands of years. But the long captivity affected his strength: the exhausted Elga needed rest. While he was resting, Faris informed the surviving allies of the return of the lord and gave the order to leave the dragon world to avenge her master. <br><br>
										<b>Revenge of Paris</b><br><br>
										But suddenly Faris reappeared in the human world and finally freed the captive dragon: the darkness brought into her soul along with Elga's heart completely absorbed the sorceress — now she is a faithful servant of the dragon. After her release, Elga needed some time to regain her strength, while Faris did not sit still.: she took it upon herself to notify the other dragons about the release of their leader and gather an army to re-attack the human world.
